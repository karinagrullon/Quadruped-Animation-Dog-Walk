# Quadruped Animation: Dog Walk
Quadruped animation, specifically dog walk. 

# # About this project
The manual animation method developed here allows the dog’s walk motion by applying geometric transformations to the
primitives that compose the dog’s body structure. This particular model is built
from 32 primitives. Each part is set to be animated separately, but coordination
between each moving part is expected for realism. Motion parameters are
predefined with values that resemble a dog's natural motion. The animation is set to
start by making right click and choosing “Walk” from the menu or pressing the letter "p" on your keyboard continiously. Motion data for this method is gathered by observation of the video of a dog walking. The intuited mobility of the
dog will then be replicated on the model. </br>

Adding animation manually to characters is the most basic approach.
However, there exist other methods such as procedural, physically based, inversekinematic
and/or a combination of various of these methods.
